# Machine-Learning-Coursera-ANG
This repo includes vectorized implementations of  exercises related to Machine Learning course offered by Andrew NG at Stanford university.
The course contents can be found at https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning
I recommend this course to anyone who is interested in this field, as it is a really good starting point for beginners.

## Note:

  * Only the files which are required to be changed in the exercises  are given here.
  * Therefore not all the files are available at this repo.
  * Try your best before look into these vectorized implementations as sometimes it may be difficult to understand the code by just looking at it since the underlying mathematical derivations are not provided.
